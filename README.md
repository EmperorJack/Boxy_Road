# Boxy Road
2D side scrolling game coded in Processing.

~Background~

For a creative coding project I had to create a simple game. The main goal was to aim for good player interaction and only use primitive graphics. Later once the interactions were nailed we could skin our game, I stayed with a simple geometric look.

I drew inspiration from side scrolling games with forced movement, generative levels and a difficulty that increases over time. To add a twist to mine I allowed omni-directional movement for the player and created pick-ups that slow down the game speed (as well as traditional coins for points). The pick-ups make the game easier but means the player has to go out of there way to get them.
